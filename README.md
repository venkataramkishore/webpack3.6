# webpack3.6
webpack3.6 build with babel compiler

Motivation is to create a simple project using webpack build system. Although we have lot of frameworks-cli available, this is just for learning purpose.

My idea is to create a working build system with regular development work.
This branch contains TypeScript compiler, jquery and bootstrap imported in ts file.
You can clone this project or just copy files for setup your own project.

If you want to test the build system.
1. clone the project
2. npm install - at root directory
3. npm start - will start application in browser with port 3000
4. npm run build - will create production build.
